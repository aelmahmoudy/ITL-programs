this is a small prayer times application.  it is based on thamer mahmoud's
itl library, which can be downloaded from http://www.arabeyes.org.  images
were obtained from both google's personalized homepage and
http://weather.allrefer.com.

this application is designed to run within a notification (tray) area.
gnome, kde, xfce, fluxbox, and others have this.  for window managers
without this (openbox, for example), a good alternative is the "trayer"
application.

if you run into any problems or have any requests, comments, suggestions,
or would like to help, please send me an email.
